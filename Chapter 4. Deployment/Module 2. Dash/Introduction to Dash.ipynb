    "# Introduction: What is Dash?\n",
    "\n",
    "__Dash__ is a a productive framework made by Plotly for building web applications with custom user interfaces that is available in Python, R and Julia. They are written on top of Flask, Plotly.js and React.js, which enables us to create analytical web applications for data visualization in pure Python without the need of HTML, CSS and JavaScript! Dash apps are rendered in the web browser and can easily be deployed and shared via URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wondering what these look like? Luckily, Plotly has a gallery of example apps for us to check out [here](https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/Portal/)! Dash apps can be used in a vast amount of fields that require elegant and intuitive UIs to be built around models and data visualization, ranging from finance, medicine, bioinformatics, mining, machine learning, and many more! \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, they can be used over plain data dashboards, which are information management tools that visually tracks, analyzes and displays metrics and key data points to monitor the health of a business, department or process. Common dashboards are passive systems that present pre-generated data, whereas dash web apps allow interaction with parameters, datasets, sending emails with actions and items running AI models with a touch a button among other features!\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we make a Dash app? These apps are made with four main components that we are going to cover today:\n",
    "- Initialization of the app: creating a dash.Dash (for a webapp) object or JypyterDash (for a Jupyter notebook) object\n",
    "- App layout: Structuring the layout of the page with Dash core components and Dash HTML components\n",
    "- Plotly graphs: Dash uses Plotly graphs data visualization\n",
    "- Callback: Enables interactivity between user inputs and outputs in our app\n",
    "\n",
    "Those three components are responsible for 100% of the functionality of (offline) dash apps. We can also create visualize our Dash apps on Jupyter notebooks by using the _jupyter\\_dash_ library. Here we see a demo of a Dash app that we can use on Jupyter notebooks available [here](https://medium.com/plotly/introducing-jupyterdash-811f1f57c02e)."

    "Before we dive into __Dash components__, let us take a quick glance of the standard structure of basic webpages. Generally speaking, the basis of any webpages are __HyperText Markup Language (HTML)__, __Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)__, and __JavaScript__. As shown in the diagram:\n",
    "- HTML is responsible for the content & structure displayed on a webpage via a nested structure of native elements (html, head, body, div, p, h1, etc)\n",
    "- CSS is responsible for the presentation of the webpage by styling of individual/groups of elements\n",
    "- JavaScript is responsible for the behaviour of the webpage, enabling interactivity with the user\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%\" src=https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7pXla4gYcSU/XB-aQElY_zI/AAAAAAAAHTA/soP-84BDatwdPyeo3jrwtQxQAvzbQIbUgCLcBGAs/s1600/js_css_html.png>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What Dash provides us is (roughly) an abstraction of these primitive building blocks, enabling us to get all their functionality on a webpage using pure Python. The _app_ object that we created has a ___.layout___ attribute, which we can assign our structure of components. Components in Dash apps come in two flavours: __HTML Components__ and __Dash Core Components__. The general idea behind the layout structure of our app is very similar to how we would structure the HTML for a page, and in fact, is roughly what Dash is doing in the background. Let us take a closer look at the _app.layout_ structure for the demo Dash app we have seen above:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"position:relative; left:300px;\" src=\"images/dash_layout_structure.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "After a close inspection we can see that:\n",
    "- __app.layout follows the same nesting structure as ordinary HTML__\n",
    "    - We see that the primary container (html.Div) has other objects inside it, and the html.Label contains both the text \"colorscale\" and the dropdown element\n",
    "- This nesting structure is obtained in Python such that elements that 'contain' other elements (like html.Div) take in a list as their argument, where each value of the list are the constituent components!\n",
    "    - This means that html.Div contains the title, graph and label; the label contains the description and dropdown menu, and so on\n",
    "- We can use Dash Core components (dcc) and HTML Components (html) interchangeably in our layout\n",
    "- We can also pass in _className_ or _id_ for keyword arguments (such as for the dropdown object) as identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "And this is how we can generate the layout structure for our Dash app. For those of you that are web-dev savy, it is useful to note that __you can also edit the style attribute of Dash HTML elements__. For those of you that are not that familiar with HTML, don't worry, as you can get away with creating apps that are essentially composed of 95% Dash Core components.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the whole point of a Dash app is that it's not static, but should instead enable the user to interact with whatever you've built. This is where callbacks come in!"

Dash abstracts what can often be quite cumbersome to do with the ___@app.callback__ decorator. In short a __decorator__ is any callable Python object that is used to modify a function or a class. Python provides the '@' as syntax to call decorators above a given function definition to add some extra functionality.\n",

    "    - Everytime an input is changed, we want one (or more) of our outputs to change correspondingly. This is encoded in the function that we 'decorate'\n",
    "- The callback decorator takes extra arguments: one list containing __Input__ objects and one list containing __Output__ objects\n",
    "    - These arguments for our decorator gives information as to what are all the inputs it needs to track in case they change and what are all the outputs that may be edited in our callback function\n",

Here, we provide you with a saved PyTorch cnn that has been trained and achieved ~98% accuracy! Your task is to go through the _mnist_app.py_ file and complete what is missing.

    "In the code already written, you may have noticed how both Dash Core components and Dash HTML Components have taken in _style_ as a keyword argument, which takes in a dictionary of properties. This is analogous to how inline styles works with ordinary HTML elements, and enables us to tweak specific properties of a given element. For example, 'width':'50%' assigns the width of the element to 50% of the width of the container in which it is in (in this case, generally html.Div). This allowed us to manually position and resize our figures, images, text, etc. Styling is just as important as the structure of the webpage itself!\n",
    "\n",
    "We can take Inline Styles a step further and write what are known as __Cascading Styling Sheets (CSS)__, which are external files that tell us how we should style different elements in our webpage. In the simplest form of CSS, we can target individual components via their 'id' keyword argument, or a group of components via the 'className' keyword argument, all without clustering our Python file with Inline Styles. By giving specific style properties to all elements of the same class, we can get themed elements (e.g. all buttons have same colour, width, padding, font, etc). While we won't go over it today, keep in mind that CSS can do much more than this!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not go over writing your own CSS today, but will rather focus on how to link CSS files to your app. Dash has a simple mechanism for importing css files: __create a directory called 'assets' in the same directory as the app, then place desired CSS files in this 'assets' directory__.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, we already have a CSS file in our assets directory, which is what we used to display the three images in our app side by side! You may find various useful element structures and styes online that you would like to implement in your own apps, and you can easily do so this way.\n",

    "So now that we have CSS, we're set in terms of styling... right? Not quite. It may take a lot of learning and digging to create appropriately styled elements in our Dash App, whether we're using Inline Styles or CSS. Very often, it's a better use of our time using the work already done by amazing people who really know their stuff. One simple way in which we can do this, is by using __Dash Bootstrap Components__. __Bootstrap__ is a popular front-end open source toolkit, and they have their own components library available for Dash! Check out their documentation [here](https://dash-bootstrap-components.opensource.faculty.ai/).\n",
